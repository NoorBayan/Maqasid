#  DVC Ignore File
# ==========================================================
# This file specifies files and directories that DVC should
# ignore and not attempt to track. The syntax is the same
# as .gitignore.

# --- Directories managed by Git ---
# We explicitly tell DVC to ignore our source code, tests, and web app code,
# as these are handled by Git.
