**Maqasid** is an end-to-end framework designed to address the critical challenges in the computational thematic analysis of Arabic poetry. It provides a robust methodology and a suite of tools for researchers, developers, and digital humanists to explore the rich, multifaceted themes inherent in one of the world's oldest literary traditions.

This project moves beyond simple single-label classification by introducing a novel hierarchical thematic taxonomy and a powerful hybrid deep learning model capable of understanding thematic complexity and overlap.

## üìú Project Overview

The computational analysis of Arabic poetry has been hindered by its thematic intricacy and a significant lack of comprehensively annotated corpora. **Maqasid** directly tackles these issues by delivering:

1.  **A Richly Annotated Corpus:** A new, large-scale, multi-label Arabic poetry dataset built upon a novel, literature-grounded hierarchical thematic schema.
2.  **An Optimized Hybrid Model:** A `CNN-BiLSTM` architecture that synergistically captures both local linguistic features and long-range sequential context, powered by custom-trained `FastText` embeddings.
3.  **An Interactive Platform:** An intuitive web application built with Streamlit that allows users to analyze new poems and interactively explore the annotated corpus.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Label Classification:** Accurately assigns multiple, co-occurring themes to a single poem, reflecting its true literary nature.
- **Hierarchical Thematic Schema:** Based on seven authoritative works of Arabic literary criticism, our schema captures thematic nuances with up to four levels of specificity.
- **Poetry-Specific Embeddings:** Utilizes a custom `FastText` model trained from scratch on our poetry corpus to understand archaic and metaphorical language.
- **End-to-End MLOps Pipeline:** The entire project is structured with modern MLOps practices, using `DVC` for data versioning and providing a reproducible pipeline.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly web app to both demonstrate the model's capabilities and serve as a powerful tool for scholarly research.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (required by `pyfarasa`)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) for cloning the repository.
- [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/install) for pulling the data and models.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/maqasid.git
cd maqasid
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all required Python packages for development, testing, and running the app.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Pull Data and Models with DVC

The large data and model files are tracked with DVC. Pull them from the remote storage.

```bash
dvc pull
```
*(Note: You may need to configure your DVC remote first if you are contributing.)*

### 5. Run the Interactive Web Application

Launch the Streamlit application with the following command:

```bash
streamlit run web_app/app.py
```

Your browser should open a new tab with the **Maqasid** dashboard running locally!
