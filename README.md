**Maqasid** is an end-to-end research framework designed to address the critical challenges in the computational thematic analysis of Arabic poetry. It provides a robust methodology and a suite of tools for researchers, developers, and digital humanists to explore the rich, multifaceted themes inherent in one of the world's oldest literary traditions.

This project moves beyond simple single-label classification by introducing a novel hierarchical thematic taxonomy and a powerful hybrid deep learning model capable of understanding thematic complexity and overlap.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multi-Label Classification:** Accurately assigns multiple, co-occurring themes to a single poem, reflecting its true literary nature.
- **Hierarchical Thematic Schema:** A novel taxonomy based on seven authoritative works of Arabic literary criticism, capturing thematic nuances with up to four levels of specificity.
- **Poetry-Specific Embeddings:** Utilizes a custom `FastText` model trained from scratch on our poetry corpus to understand archaic and metaphorical language.
- **Reproducible MLOps Pipeline:** The entire project is structured with modern MLOps practices, using `DVC` for data versioning to ensure full reproducibility.
- **Interactive Tools:** A user-friendly web application and a Google Colab notebook for model demonstration and in-depth corpus exploration.

## 📊 The Maqasid Corpus

At the heart of this project is the **Maqasid Corpus**, a new, large-scale, and richly annotated dataset of Arabic poetry. It was constructed to overcome the limitations of existing resources and to serve as a foundational tool for computational literary analysis.

- **Size:** Contains [الرجاء إدخال عدد القصائد، مثلاً +20,000] poems from various historical eras.
- **Annotation:** Each poem is annotated with multiple thematic labels from our hierarchical schema, capturing thematic co-occurrence.
- **Grounding:** The thematic taxonomy was developed through a rigorous synthesis of classical and modern Arabic literary criticism, ensuring scholarly validity.
- **Accessibility:** The corpus is made available to the research community to foster new, data-driven inquiries into Arabic literature.

## 🔬 Interactive Exploration with Google Colab

To enhance the accessibility and promote hands-on analysis of the **Maqasid Corpus**, we have developed an interactive Google Colab notebook. This tool empowers anyone—from students to seasoned researchers—to visually explore, filter, and analyze the dataset directly in their browser with zero setup.

➡️ **[Open the Interactive Explorer in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Z6r-Q37jYzyjHcR-nAtRXRfr9BTAWLYG?usp=drive_link)**

The notebook features two powerful, user-friendly dashboards:

#### 1. Thematic Poem Browser

This dashboard provides an intuitive way to navigate the corpus through its rich thematic hierarchy. It allows you to:

-   **Drill-Down Through Themes**: Start from broad categories (e.g., "Love Poetry") and progressively narrow your focus to highly specific sub-themes (e.g., "Chaste Love" → "Love from a distance").
-   **Instantly Access Poems**: As you select a theme, the interface immediately populates a list of all poems annotated with that specific theme.
-   **View Detailed Poem Analysis**: Clicking on a poem reveals its full text, essential metadata (poet, era), and an interactive pie chart that visualizes its complete thematic composition.

#### 2. Cross-Era Thematic Analysis Dashboard

Designed for comparative literary studies, this advanced analytical tool enables data-driven investigation into the evolution of poetic themes across different historical periods. Its key functionalities include:

-   **Targeted Analysis**: Select a primary theme (e.g., "Praise Poetry") and a specific historical era (e.g., "Umayyad Period") to focus your inquiry.
-   **Dynamic Visualization**: The tool automatically generates a series of hierarchical bar charts that break down the chosen theme into its sub-themes, displaying the frequency of each within the selected era.
-   **Uncover Literary Trends**: This dashboard facilitates empirical answers to complex research questions, such as: *"Which sub-themes of Satire were most prevalent in the Abbasid era compared to the Modern era?"*

This powerful feature transforms the Maqasid Corpus from a static dataset into a dynamic laboratory for literary and historical inquiry.
