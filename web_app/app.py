            This project was born out of the need to address the significant challenges in the computational 
            analysis of Arabic poetry, namely its thematic complexity, frequent thematic overlap, and the 
            scarcity of comprehensively annotated data.
            
            #### Key Contributions:
            1.  **A Novel Annotated Corpus:** We meticulously created a large-scale, multi-label Arabic poetry corpus, 
                annotated according to a new, literature-grounded hierarchical thematic taxonomy and validated by domain experts.
            
            2.  **An Optimized Hybrid Model:** We developed a hybrid deep learning model that synergistically integrates 
                Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction with Bidirectional Long Short-Term 
                Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for sequential context modeling. This model leverages custom FastText embeddings 
                trained from scratch on our poetic corpus.
                
            3.  **This Interactive Platform:** This web application makes our model and data accessible, fostering 
                more sophisticated, data-driven research in Arabic digital humanities.
